          <strong>Notes:</strong>
          I find it both interesting and practical that Boostrtaps allows you to easily add interactive elements
          like carousels or dropdowns to a webpage by simply linking its CSS and JS files and
          inserting each component’s code snippet. This saves time and lets you
          focus on other aspects such as the content of your webpage.

          <strong>Notes:</strong>
          I found it very curious how Tailwind automatically removes unnecesary CSS so the webpage ships faster. I have struggled in the past with big CSS files that slow down the loading of my page so I find this tool particularly useful. 
		  <strong>Downside:</strong> Unfortunately, the downside is that in order to make the CSS smaller, you need to use utility classes so the HTML which can end up making it too long and hard to read. However, I believe with a good organisation and differentiation, it can be handled.

  <h3>My choice</h3>
        
          <strong>TailwindCSS</strong>
<p>
         Personally, I like the freedom and flexibility that TailwindCSS offers. Whereas Bootstrap is ready-made and it might be better for corporate webs in a more serious or generic context, I believe as a designer I would want to be more creative and stand out with a customised webpage.

          <strong>Notes:</strong>
		I find this UI kit very easy to implement as it includes ready-made templates. This is great for certain projects where efficiency and consistency are more important than creativity and originality.
		
		  <strong>Downside:</strong> The use of templates can be very useful to begin with, but it can end up looking too generic if you don´t customise it to fit your style and needs. This customisation might take more time and the learning curve might be tougher so that´s something to consider.

        </figure>
        <p>
          <strong>Notes:</strong>
		The amount of components that Ark UI offers is quite impressive and useful to incorporate in my projects. It includes basic components such as buttons to more complex ones such as carosuels, menus and even signature pads or date pickers. It has almost every component you would need for your site so i would highly consider incorporating them in my sites.

          <figcaption>Date picker</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          <strong>Notes:</strong>
		The fact that components do not have default styles allows you to customise them in order to fit your aesthetic which is really useful to build a design-centered and original website. Ark UI gives you the base and you can build up from there. It is also compatiple with many styling solutions such as TailwindCSS so using both would be an option to consider in future projects.

    <!-- SECTION 3 -->
    <section id="static" aria-labelledby="static-title">
      <h2 id="static-title">Static Site Generators and Templates</h2>
      <article>
  <h2><a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a></h2>
  <div class="article-textbox">Jekyll is a static site generator that uses Markdown, Liquid templates, and YAML front matter for flexible content management.</div>
  <h3>Front Matter</h3>
        <figure>
          <img src="Screenshot 2025-09-19 at 09.12.56.png"
               alt="Front Matter in Jekyll"

          <figcaption>Front Matter in Jekyll</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          <strong>Notes:</strong>

		  I learnt about front matter and the use of variables to manage metadata in Jekyll using YAML. This allows you to establish variables such as title or layout at the beggining of the site in order to use them across different pages. This ensures consistency and it saves time and space since you only need to change it once in the front matter instead of in every individual page.

        </p>

  <h3>Liquid Template Language</h3>
<figure>
          <img src="Screenshot 2025-09-19 at 09.27.21.png"

          <figcaption>Liquid template language in Jekyll</figcaption>
        </figure>
		 
        </figure>
        <p>
          <strong>Notes:</strong>

          Something that caught my attention about Jekyll is that it uses its own template language called Liquid. This allows you to reuse certain components and elements across different pages of the site which keeps consistency and saves time. I like how it acts as a glue between content (Markdown) and metadata (YAML), placing them into HTML layouts. The result is a static site with dynamic content which I find very interesting and convenient.

          <strong>Notes:</strong>

		The depth of GSAP is quite outstanding. However, one of the features that cought my attention the most was the ScrollTrigger plugin. I imagine this can be really handy to create interactive and inmersive webpages that react to the user´s scrolling behaviour. A good example would be a portfolio which would more depth and dynamisms thanks to this plugin and would be more original and eye-catching to users.

        </figure>
        <p>
          <strong>Notes:</strong>

		 Another feature that I found interesting is the posibility of animating SVGs which can be very useful to add interactivity to the logos and icons of your webpage. Within this feature there are several options such as morphTo(), to morph one SVG into another or the otionPath() to animate the SVG along a specified path.
Additionally I really like how the website of Anime.js animates sections to showcase each feature, making it more appealing and easy to understand.

  <h3>My choice</h3>
        
          <strong></strong>

          <p>
    
My choice of animation library will highly depend of the type of website I want to build. If I want more complex animations I would definitely choose GSAP, although I would have to consider both the learning difficulty and the heavier weight it adds to the page, which involves more loading time. However, if I want to create simpler and smalller animations, which result in a more lightweight webpage, I would choose Anime.js.

		 For us graphic designers, images are crucial, especially if we want to showcase our won projects so I find this tool really useful. Optimization and compression not only adds quality to images but also ensures the loading time of the web is not too long. It offers a free plan which includes a media library for your projects which improves UX. I also love how in a single program you can edit images, crop them and even add filters and adjust lighting and colors to make them ready to use for your website
